# Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities to us through email. You can email us at `contact@forwarderfactory.com`.
If a vulnerability is reported that we deem important enough, you will receive a spot in the `Credits` page on the site, as a thank you.
We don't use versioning (at least as of now), so we will deploy the fix publically and immediately deploy the fix on our serverside.
